### Welcome

* Welcome, everyone. I’m Kati Michel. I'm thrilled to have been asked to share this talk with you.
* I’m really hoping that some of what I share today will be life changing for you the way that it has been for me

</td><td>

### Talk Goal

* When I first created this talk 3 years ago, I had learned a lot of what is in it from being the DjangoCon US website maintainer
* I wanted to teach other people, especially women, how to get started collaborating and doing code review as quickly as possible.
* I included a lot of screenshots in this talk, because I want people to see what the process looks like, in a way that I didn’t
* I really felt like I was in the dark while I was learning
* I really packed the talk with a lot of knowledge… a lot of this had been difficult to learn and had taken some courage

</td><td>

### Good News

* I have good news
* Now that I’ve had the benefit of several years of using what’s in the talk, I’ve improved the talk
* There are a couple of things that I’ve learned that are really important
* This is not about how much you know… it’s about knowing a few things that enable you to be proficient
* There are people who are successful in using Git and GitHub who literally just use the same handful of commands and basic process over and over again
* I’m not trying to discourage you from knowing a lot or improving
* If you start to get discouraged or overwhelmed… just remember that the goal is to figure out a mental model and commands that you can use permanently

Toward the end of the talk, I’m going to have an exercise you can do to get started using these commands in a practical way that will enable you to do a lot

### More Good News

* Git and GitHub are a highly valuable, “gateway” skill... becoming proficient leads to many other opportunities
* Not all Git/GitHub usage is public… it’s also used privately
* Knowing how to use Git and GitHub led to me being hired not long after I created this talk

### More Good News- Hacktoberfest

* Hacktoberfest is a month long celebration of open source
* If you make four PRs to active projects on GitHub and are do not miss the cut-off, you get a shirt and swag
* It’s a great time to contribute, because projects will be looking for contributors

### Announcing TacoFancy

* I want to tell you how I got started using open-source
* I signed up for GitHub in April 2013. My account sat unused for 7 months. I didn’t know how to get started.
* I happened to be looking at Twitter. 
* I saw a tweet from a man named Dan Sinker. He had made a really delicious taco meal and decided to start a project on GitHub to share taco recipes. 
* So I clicked on the link and went to the project to take a look.

### My First Pull Request

* At the time, I felt like an outsider. This was the encouragement I needed. 
* I became very determined to contribute and submitted my first pull request there.
* I wanted to build on this experience, so I kept using Git and GitHub. I wasn’t very good at it at first
* A lot of what I did was alone in my own account. But I improved. I learned that the mistakes disappear in the history.

### DjangoCon US Website as Example Project

* Eventually, I wanted to start contributing to something
* I realized that a lot of conferences were looking for website contributors
* In 2016, I became a DjangoCon US website contributor
* I wanted to become a maintainer. My git skills were leveling off and I recognized that being a maintainer was a valuable skill and I was curious.
* So I just asked if I could learn how to maintain the DjangoCon US website
* The conference leaders wholeheartedly said yes and offered me the role of Website Chair, which I accepted
* That is where I began to learn how to be a maintainer, including how to review/merge PRs
* That led me to write this talk and it’s why I use the DjangoCon US website as an example project in this talk

### Prerequisites for Getting Started

* These are the things that will need to be set up to do what is explained in this talk
* At the end of my talk will be a slide with a link to the slides and other useful resources

* Create a free GitHub account online
* Install Git on your computer and set your email and username
* Find and open your command line (a.k.a. terminal) on your computer
* Be able to navigate via command line (See Bash commands)
* You might also want to have a text editor of your choice installed, to use to edit files (I use VS Code)
You will find documentation for all of these things in the Useful Resources section.

### Housekeeping

* Even though I use the word “code” in the title, this talk is more about learning the process… to enable you to do more difficult things
* My screenshots will be in Mac OS: in the GitHub docs, there are tabs that can give info specific by OS
* But, I think the high level process I will show you will be the same

### What are Git and GitHub?

* GitHub is a website built on the version control software Git. 
* I don’t know if you’ve ever been working on a file and comically saved a million versions… Git does that for you.
* Originally Git was just used in the command line only
* The people who built GitHub basically took Git and integrated the functionality into a user friendly website

### Local Development Environment Example

* This is why it’s it’s going to look very different if you do something on GitHub the website versus in your local development environment
When we are working on code, we can't do everything in the GitHub website (although there is a new product called Codespaces in beta)
* For example, we might want to make a copy of the DjangoCon US website code in the local development environment of our computer, install the necessary software, and run the code in a local browser so that you can add a feature to it, or test a pull request branch.
* There is where Git is very useful. Git is installed in our local development environment and used in the command line of your computer. You can use Git to make a snapshot of your project at any point in time and revert back if needed.
* Here is a screenshot of my local development environment.
* In the background I have GitHub open in the browser
* In front of that, I have my local folder window and my command line

### The Two Collaborative Development Models

A Collaborative Development Model is a fancy term for how users contribute to a repo. There are two different models. 
* "Shared Repository" Model
* "Fork and Pull" Model
The two different models typically correspond to the two different account types and which model you uses depends on whether you have write permission to the repo.

</td><td>

### The Two Types of Accounts

* To explain these, I’m going to talk about the two different kinds of accounts
* Organization accounts such as the DjangoCon organization that a group of people have access to
* User accounts that one person has access to, such as my own personal account

</td><td>

### Write Permission

* There is a thing called “write permission”
* We are not talking about "write" permission in the context of English.
* When a user has write permission to a repo, it means they can make changes directly inside of the repo.

</td></tr>


<table>

<tr><td width="30%">

</td><td>

### Examples of What Write Permission Will Allow You to Do

* Edit files
* Push branches directly to the repo (instead of via fork)
* Merge and close pull requests

</td></tr>

![Slide 28](https://speakerd.s3.amazonaws.com/presentations/de118609b58d4004b7a402c5a34b3b99/slide_27.jpg)

</td><td>

### Why We Need Write Permission

* We need write permission because the code inside of a repo can be really valuable

Example: DjangoCon US website is deployed live from the main branch and has a fairly high volume of traffic. 
* We wouldn't want just anyone to be able to go into the DjangoCon repo and directly make changes. 
* Someone could damage the codebase
* So, the repo owner will give a few, trusted people write permission

</td><td>

### Write Permission and Collaboration Examples

* The way that we contribute to a repo depends on whether we have write permission to the repo

* Let’s go back to the idea of the “Shared Repository” Model.
* A shared repository is typically found in an organization account, because you have a group of maintainers who all have write access to a repo so that they can maintain it. A user account repo can be a shared repo but it’s not as common. I might be wrong.
* For example, the DjangoCon US website repo is a shared repository. When I became a maintainer, I was given write permission to the repo. Along with the other maintainers, who also have write permission, I can make changes directly within the DjangoCon US website repo.

</td><td>

### Write Permission and Collaboration Examples

(Animation)
So what happens if you don’t have write permission, but you want to contribute to a repo?
* In that case, you use the “Fork and Pull” Model. 
* This often happens in a user account
* The person who wants to contribute makes a copy of the repo in their own user account. The copy is called a fork. Because the fork is in their own user account, they have write permission to it. 
* For example, when I first came across the DjangoCon US website repo, I wanted to contribute, but I was not a maintainer, so I didn't have write permission. So I forked the DjangoCon US website repo into user account, made a change to it, then submitted a pull request to the Django US website repo.

### How to Fork a Repo

We've gone to the DjangoCon US website repo. 
* Click the "Fork" button
* Try to edit a file in a repository that you do not have write permission to. GitHub will automatically fork the repo to your user account.

### Forked Repo

(Animation)
* Click on the hyperlink and it will open the repo
* The repo URL will have my user account name in it (that’s called a namespace)
* The fork is an exact copy of the original repo at the time it was forked. I could make any changes I wanted to the fork, including deleting it, and the original repo will not be affected. 
* In addition to using a fork to propose a change to the original repo, you can also use a fork for the starting point of a new idea of your own (depending on the license).

### Collaboration and Code Review Best Practice Workflow Using Branches

* So, you’ve identified how you are going to contribute… through a shared repo or a fork of it

* When I first started using GitHub, I would go into my own GitHub repo, click on a file, click on the pencil icon to open the file, make a change, and save it. 
* This is fine, but imagine if there were multiple people all working on a repo and all of them were going into files and making changes and saving them. It wouldn't be very practical. For instance, how would you give feedback? 
* As the complexity of a project increases, within the repo, we need to make copies of the codebase to work on the code. These copies are called branches.

### Reasons for Using Branches

* There are multiple benefits to using branches
* To keep your main branch stable
* To work on features outside of the main branch, which may also take time
* So that you can test and review code before merging it into your main branch

### Branches

* When you create or fork a repo, the default branch is probably called master (or main)
* By the way, GitHub has recently given the option to go into your account settings and tick a box to make the default branch as main, instead of master, due to the historical context of that word
* I highly recommend doing that and I have changed references in this talk from master to main

### Branches

Say for instance that you want to make a change in the branch, you can make a new branch (which is a copy of the original branch) and give it a different name. Now there are two branches, in the same repo, the main branch and a feature branch (GitHub will also refer to a feature branch as a topic branch).

### Bash Commands

In GitHub, we navigate using the browser. In the local development environment, we need to use the command line to navigate directories

We can use Bash commands to do that. The commands below are enough to be able to use git. The other commands we are going to use in this talk are git commands.

A couple useful things to know
* Some tasks vary by operating system- check tabs at the top of GitHub articles for special OS instructions; For instance, not all command lines use a $
* <variable> is a placeholder for the real thing

### Pull Request Command Line

There are some situations though where you need to fetch the pull request branch into your local development environment so you can run the code or run a test or work on the code in order to be able to merge it.
When you click on the “command line instructions” link, it will open up a set of instructions for how to review and (possibly) merge the pull request in your local development environment. The instructions will be different depending on whether the pull request was submitted from within the shared repository or from a forked repo. The instructions are different because Git handles shared repos and forks differently locally. This is kind of irrelevant though.

### Pull Request Review

There is some overlap in terms of the merge button and the command line instructions
* If you follow the entire instruction set, you will manually merge the pull request branch locally into the branch it is intended to merge with and push it to that branch on GitHub
* I don’t do that. I just follow the instructions to fetch the branch.
* If I verify that it can be merged, I ignore the rest of the instructions and go back to the GitHub PR tab and click the merge button
* The branch might be protected and you can revert the PR

### Sandboxing

This is the advice I wish I had had:
* Create a repo in your own GitHub user account (this can public or private)
* Use it to practice the your workflow until you feel confident to use it to contribute to a project
* GitHub has a basic tutorial called Hello World… you can use it to create a repo, a branch, submit a pull request, and merge it
* I have included this link in the Useful Resources and you might be interested in it
* But everything in that tutorial happens in the browser
* You can do make some contributions in the browser only… but there is a limit to what you can do there
* If working in the browser only is what you feel comfortable with, that’s totally fine
* You should do whatever works for you
* The reason why I’m talking about the local dev environment is that it enables you to do more and it’s getting into more of what a dev environment is like
* If it’s something you don’t feel comfortable doing today, it’s maybe something to work toward

### Simple, But Effective

* Continuing with this idea of using a sandbox repo to practice

### Pushing Commits to a Pull Request

* You can also submit a pull request to yourself and use the command line instructions (but if the branch is local, you can’t fetch it)

* The good news is that pull request branches are regular branches
* You can push changes to the pull request branch up to the point that the PR is merged… the changes will be added to the PR

### Triaging

Tips for getting started
In the Useful Resources section there is an excellent checklist for evaluating a project and I recommend that you take a look at it. In general...
I recommend that when you are looking for a project to contribute to:
* Search by tag to find projects that use triaging. Triaging is where issues are sorted by difficulty level
* Maintainers will be creating “hacktoberfest” labels
* Be aware for “help wanted” that these can be their *problem* issues
* As a collaborator or code reviewer, you can cherry-pick issues and pull requests that fit your skill level

### Finding Community Projects Versus Via GitHub Search

* Instead of finding projects through GitHub search, considering finding them through your community instead
* One year, my local developer community collected a list of local projects
* A lot of the projects were for non-profits and didn’t have proper docs and other stuff
*  My contributions that year were really nice README.mds with installation instructions.

### When You Locate a Project

* It’s a good idea to…
* Use the GitHub Open Source Guide Contributing Checklist
* Look for a CONTRIBUTING.md (might be in the .github repo… will tell you how they want you to contribute)
Let them know if you (in issue):
* Find an issue you want to take
* Think of a feature that you want to add

### Documentation

I hope that you will make your project documentation and attitude toward community members welcoming and positive. This is a way to increase the number of contributions and increase diversity. You can go to the Useful Resources Section, follow the links to the DjangoCon US website repo documentation and use them as examples. Documentation is considered extremely useful, but is often missing.
* README.md- gives general project information
* LICENSE- tells you the legal terms under which you can contribute and use the code
* CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md- a set of rules outlining the expectations and responsibilities of contributors 
* CONTRIBUTING.md- gives info about contributing. (look for .github repo)
